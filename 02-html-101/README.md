## Commenting your code

`<!-- This is how you comment HTML code -->`

---
> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Break now for a class exercise. Have students create a very simple profile page for themselves with their name, place of birth, email address, place of work (if applicable, otherwise NSS), and an unordered list of interests. Make sure student comment their code to describe the purpose of each element.

## Block elements vs inline elements  
Just touch on this by showing how some elements fill the width of their parent and some don't. Planting the seed for later when we begin styling.

A block element is an element that has, but may not be limited to, the following characteristics:

+ If no width is set, will expand naturally to fill its parent container
+ Can have margins and/or padding
+ If no height is set, will expand naturally to fit its child elements (assuming they are not floated or positioned)
+ By default, will be placed below previous elements in the markup (assuming no floats or positioning on surrounding elements)
+ Ignores the vertical-align property  

Examples: `<p>, <div>, <form>, <header>, <nav>, <ul>, <li>, and <h1>`

An inline element has, but may not be limited to, the following characteristics:

+ Flows along with text content, thus
+ Will not clear previous content to drop to the next line like block elements
+ Is subject to white-space settings in CSS
+ Will ignore top and bottom margin settings, but will apply left and right margins, and any padding
+ Will ignore the width and height properties
+ If floated left or right, will automatically become a block-level element, subject to all block characteristics
+ Is subject to the vertical-align property

The easiest way to picture an inline element is to think of it as a box that acts like text. What happens, for example, to text thatâ€™s not separated by other elements? It flows one letter after the other. If you put an inline element next to text, it will flow next to that text just like another piece of text.  
Examples: `<a>, <span>, <b>, <em>`


> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Break now for a class exercise. Live-code some example where a span or anchor tag is a child of a block element, and then show a block element child.
