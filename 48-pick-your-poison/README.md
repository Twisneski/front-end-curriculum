# Pick Your Poison Team Project

Class will be broken up into teams, and each team will choose between building a game, building a mobile application, or a desktop application.

## Phaser

[Phaser](http://phaser.io/) is arguably the most popular JavaScript framework for building a browser-based game in the market today.

## Ionic

[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) is a library that lets you build mobile applications with Angular and Firebase. If you pick this, make sure you install the [Ionic lab](http://lab.ionic.io/) tool.

## Electron

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) is a tool from Github that allows you to package up a browser-based application as a desktop application. The most famous tool that uses Electron is Slack.
