# The Gauntlet

Group project to further understand prototypal inheritance by modifying an existing, but incomplete, game to pit combatants against each other.

> **Intructor suggestion:** Time for another group project. Split class up into teams of three, create a Github Classroom group project, and provide the boilerplate for the [Gauntlet repository](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/gauntlet).
