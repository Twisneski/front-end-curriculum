## What is CSS?

In the earliest days of the World Wide Web, there were just documents. The Web was intended to share research documents, and so things that we see now like dynamic applications, beautiful layouts and colors, and cool animations were not even thought of.

Then, companies started to see a glimmer of promise for making money on the Web, so they started sharing their documents. Plain, boring text didn't cut it, so the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) released CSS1 in 1996 so that professional web page developers - there weren't that many yet - could create more stylized documents with complex layouts and color schemes.
