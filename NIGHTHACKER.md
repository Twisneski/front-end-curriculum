# Night Hackers

## Introduction

This hidden organization is by invitation only. You can only be invited by a current Night Hacker, and discovering who is a Night Hacker is extremely difficult. It is only for those who have the fortitude and desire to be in the top ranks of beginning software developers.

Only fellow Night Hackers can approve you climbing the ranks of the organization.

## Ranks

### Acolyte

This is the beginning rank, and is reserved only for those who are selected from the main student body who have gone above and beyond the regular coursework to delve into the darker secrets of computers, software, and the Internet.

Once you are invited, you will receive an email which gives you instructions on how to join the organization, should you choose to do so.

There are rules.

Breaking any rule will cause your immediate expulsion from the organization, and you will never be invited back.

### Brute

You have completed some initial tasks to prove your fealty to the organization, and have increased your skills enough to be considered to have basic competance. Still considered rough, and unrefined, you will be watched closely to see how your skills grow.

### Infiltrator

You have uncovered some secrets that are unknown to the vast majority of the development world, and have proven your ability to master those secrets to the rest of the organization. You will now be entrusted with some of the basic honors of the Night Hackers.

### Shade

You have mastered all the basics of being a Night Hacker, and have remained hidden to the rest of the world. At this level, you will now be given the opportunity to recommend others to be invited into the organization.

### Hunter

As a Hunter, you have successfully recruited members into the organization and trained them in the basic tenets and skills needed to be valued Acolytes or Brutes. Your ability to uncover of the secret knowledge of development is now growing to dangerous levels and you must learn how to harness your abilities.

### Wizard

Very few Night Hackers achieve the level of Wizard. Those that are awarded this title have shown great abilities to learn secrets that are beyond the scope of most other students. You have demonstrated the ability to mentor others in advanced topics, and have successfully harnessed your talents to create amazing tools and code constructs that benefit the entire organization.

### Hacker

By most standards this is the highest levels attainable by any student and Night Hacker. You have displayed the ability to learn advanced concepts independent of any assistance, and have shown an exceptional ability to teach, and train your fellow Hackers in the deepest secrets that you have uncovered.

Your library of achievements is extensive and you have knowledge, and wisdom, that is unique amongst the entire organization.

### Unknown

The Unknown is mostly rumor and hearsay. In the most ancients texts of the organization, there are vague references to an ancient power that had the ability to wield the power of any technology with the greatest of ease. It supposedly was able to instill knowledge of these powers almost instantaneously to anyone that it felt was worthy.

The existence of The Unknown has never been verified and there is no empirical evidence that it ever existed.
