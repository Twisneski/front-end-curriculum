# HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol)

## History

## Verbs

GET, PUT, POST, DELETE

# The Web

## IP based (DNS came later)

## How it works

Walk through the process of a request from a web browser to final render, and all the steps in between.

# API & REST

Oh so fascinating presentation on API and REST.

## Firebase

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Have students sign up for a Firebase account, but you may want to discourage the usage of the interface for building large JSON documents. Have students build and verify JSON locally and import it, or use the programmatic methods to add documents.

## Use jQuery to interact with an API over HTTP

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Use the API that is exposed on the Vagrant machine at `http://192.168.33.10:8080/food` to show how to get data from an API using an AJAX call with jQuery.
