# Welcome to Nashville Software School

You have decided to embark on a journey to become one of the wizards of the modern world. As technology pervades more and more of our lives, the divide between Consumers and Producers of technology becomes wider and wider. You have chosen how to become a Producer, which can lead you down many paths:


 + Product developer
 + API developer
 + Security
 + DevOps
 + Product owner
 + Project manager
 + Entrepeneur

As a student of NSS, you have exciting challenges ahead of you. 

## Day students
You've got a new job... likely the most challenging job you've ever had. You are going to learn the basics of a career that makes you a modern day sorcerer. The abilities that you will wield at the end of your instruction wil be like magic to the layperson. However, missing days can have serious consequences. You will have 60 days to learn to be a beginner, but proficient, front end software developer. Missing just one can put you significantly behind.

It will be accelerated learning with plenty of challenges, plenty of successes, and plenty of "a ha!" moments as I try to retrain your brain to think like a software developer.

## Evening students
Many people choose the night class because they have families or jobs that prevents them from committing to the full-time day class. This means that your time-management skills will be pushed to the limits. You *will* need to code outside of class. If you find yourself not able to do this, you will fall behind quickly. We cannot stress this enough. You must follow the **ABC** principle whenever you can.
