1. Create a `/vagrant/quizzes/js102` directory on your host machine.
1. Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array as an argument, and returns a new array that is sorted. Review the following URL for help sorting numbers. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort

1. When the button is clicked retrieve the value of the input field. 
1. Convert that string of comma-delimited numbers into an array.
1. Pass that array into the function that finds numbers higher than 25. Remember how to convert strings to numbers?
