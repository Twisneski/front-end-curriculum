# Dynamic operations with first order functions

Make sure you have committed all your current changes on your current branch and have pushed to Github.

```bash
cd /vagrant/exercises
git checkout master
git checkout -b calculator
mkdir calculator && cd $_
```

1. Create an HTML file that has two input fields to accept the two numbers to perform operations on.
1. Create 4 buttons to perform each of the basic mathematical functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
1. In your JavaScript, put an event listener on each of the buttons.
1. Copy the code below an implement a basic calculator.

```js
/*
  Create a function that multiplies two numbers
  passed in as arguments. Return the product.
 */


/*
  Create a function that adds two numbers
  passed in as arguments. Return the sum.
 */


/*
  Create a function that subtracts two numbers
  passed in as arguments. Return the difference.
 */


/*
  Create a function that divides two numbers
  passed in as arguments. Return the quotient.
 */



/*
  Create a function that accepts three arguments.
    1. First number
    2. Second number
    3. A function that performs an operation on them
    
  Return the value of the operation.
 */



/*
  Create a variable to hold the return value of the
  3-argument function. 

  e.g. var result = myFunction(0, 0, func)
 */



/*
  Log the result
 */
console.log("result", result)
```
